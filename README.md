# JavaScript_loops

JavaScript provides several types of loops that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. The most commonly used loops in JavaScript are:

## For Loop:
The for loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and update.
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```


## while Loop
Reapeatedly executes a block of coe as long as a specified condtion is true.

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

## do...while Loop
Similar to while loop but the code is executed at least once before the condition is checked

```javascript
do {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
} while (condition);

```
